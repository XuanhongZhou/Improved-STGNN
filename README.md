# Improved-STGNN
Here we proposed an improved STGNN. <br>
We used the code provided by [LMissher](https://github.com/LMissher/STGNN). Thanks for his excellent implementation! <br>
However, we still faced some problems when we first ran this code. We hope the beginners could run this code easierly, thus we provided the annotated version with dataset, newcomers could run it without any difficulties. <br>
We have also adopted this [STGNN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9551450) in our paper, but we just used it with minor modification. So we are trying our best to rebuild an improved STGNN. <br>
Considering the storage size of this repository, you could access the data from the [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QMfkULcVElFI_yrxzxC9rQ?pwd=abcd), and the password is abcd. (Tip: The dataset you may download is .h5, you should run read_h5.py to generate the .npy file.) <br>
Now i am working hard to improve the performance of STGNN. I wish i could manage it!
