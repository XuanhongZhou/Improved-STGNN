# Improved-STGNN
Here we proposed an improved STGNN. <br>
We used the code provided by [LMissher](https://github.com/LMissher/STGNN). Thanks for his excellent implementation! <br>
However, we still faced some problems when we first ran this code. We hope the beginners could run this code easierly, thus we provided the annotated version with dataset, newcomers could run it without any difficulties. <br>
We have also adopted this [STGNN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9551450) in our paper ["Edge Computation Offloading With Content Caching in 6G-Enabled IoV"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10034418), but we just used it with minor modification. So we are trying our best to rebuild an improved STGNN.
